# Crowdfunding-DAppInspiration
This project was inspired by the inefficiencies of traditional crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter, which impose high fees, lack transparency, and pose risks of centralized control. The potential of blockchain technology to address these issues fueled the vision for creating a decentralized solution.

What I Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain integration, and smart contracts. I also deepened my understanding of front-end development using React.js and its interaction with blockchain technology through Web3.js.

How It Was Built
The DApp was developed using React.js for the front end, providing a dynamic and interactive interface for users to create and support projects. Solidity was used to develop the smart contracts, ensuring transparency and automating funding milestones. The development process was streamlined with Hardhat, a tool that allowed us to simulate local blockchain environments for efficient testing and deployment.
